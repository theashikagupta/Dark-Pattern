# Dark Patterns Group Project

## Overview

This repository contains the collaborative work of **DEV DEMONS** on the topic of dark patterns in digital interfaces. 
In this collaborative effort, we explore and analyze the pervasive issue of dark patterns in digital interfaces. Dark patterns are deliberate design choices employed by websites and applications to manipulate user behavior, often leading them to make unintended decisions that benefit the service at the expense of the user's interests.

### About Dark Patterns

**What are Dark Patterns?**

Dark patterns are user interface design tactics crafted to nudge, coerce, or deceive users into taking actions they might not otherwise choose. These patterns exploit psychological principles to influence decision-making, often in ways that prioritize the goals of the service provider over the user's preferences or well-being.

**Examples of Dark Patterns**

- **Misdirection:** Redirecting users' attention away from important options.
- **Hidden Costs:** Concealing additional fees or charges until a later stage of the user journey.
- **Privacy Zuckering:** Tricking users into sharing more information than they intend to.

**Why Dark Patterns Matter**

The prevalence of dark patterns raises ethical concerns about user trust, transparency, and autonomy. Understanding and identifying these patterns is crucial for promoting fair and user-friendly digital experiences.



Feel free to explore our findings, contribute to the discussion, and join us in advocating for more ethical design practices in the digital realm.
